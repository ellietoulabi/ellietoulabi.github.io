    <ul>
      <li>Conduct research in reinforcement learning and active inference to model decision-making in non-stationary environments.</li>
      <li>Compare active inference to human-like decision-making and classic RL agents in cooperative settings.</li>
      <li>Implement a model-based active inference agent using predictive-coding principles and graphical modeling.</li>
      <li>Apply variational Bayesian inference to the agent’s model to maintain beliefs about the environment.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Extended the RACER classifier to handle continuous features using supervised discretization.</li>
      <li>Evaluated CAIM, MDLP, CART, and ChiMerge methods for accuracy and interpretability.</li>
      <li>Achieved a 6.6% accuracy gain and 10–20% fewer rules, surpassing Naive Bayes, LightGBM, and SVM.</li>
