Hello, I am Elaheh Toulabinejad. I am currently a Master's student at the Department of Computing Science at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/computing-science/index.html), supervised by [James R. Wright](https://jrwright.info/). My research interests span machine learning, reinforcement learning, game theory, and cognitive science; however, my primary focus is on behavioural game theory, where I integrate ideas from these fields to understand and model how people act in strategic situations.

During my undergraduate studies at [Isfahan University of Technology](https://ece.iut.ac.ir/en), I was co-supervised by [Mohammad Hossein Manshaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=33d716cAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Sayed Jalal Zahabi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xsY6VrEAAAAJ&hl=en). My work involved modeling the human visual system using deep learning, simulating visual disorders related to DVSD and autism, and investigating the effects of learning on recovery from these disorders' symptoms.
