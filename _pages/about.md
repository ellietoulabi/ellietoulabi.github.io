<div class="about-page">
<p>Hello, I am Elaheh Toulabinejad. I am currently a Master's student at the Department of Computing Science at the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/computing-science/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Alberta</a>, supervised by <a href="https://jrwright.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James R. Wright</a>. My research interests span machine learning, reinforcement learning, game theory, and cognitive science; however, my primary focus is on behavioural game theory, where I integrate ideas from these fields to understand and model how people act in strategic situations.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate studies at <a href="https://ece.iut.ac.ir/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isfahan University of Technology</a>, I was co-supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=33d716cAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mohammad Hossein Manshaei</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xsY6VrEAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sayed Jalal Zahabi</a>. My work involved modeling the human visual system using deep learning, simulating visual disorders related to DVSD and autism, and investigating the effects of learning on recovery from these disorders' symptoms.</p>
