<div class="about-page">


<p> Hi, I’m Elaheh. I am a machine learning researcher and applied scientist specializing in deep learning and reinforcement learning. My primary research interest lies in using data-driven machine learning models to advance interpretable and robust decision-making systems. My work bridges academic research and real-world applications: I build autonomous agents capable of sequential decision-making, extract actionable insights from structured and unstructured data, and design end-to-end ML systems from prototype to production with rigorous evaluation. I thrive in cross-disciplinary settings and enjoy mentoring stakeholders to transform complex ideas into meaningful impact.

<p>
I am currently completing my Master of Science in Computing Science at the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/computing-science/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Alberta</a>, supervised by <a href="https://jrwright.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James R. Wright</a>. My research focuses on cooperative model-based reinforcement learning to understand and model how people act in strategic situations. More broadly, I aim to develop autonomous agents that learn, adapt, and coordinate in complex, non-stationary environments.
